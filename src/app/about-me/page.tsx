        About me<br></br>
        Hello! My name is Marco, and I am a software development student with a passion for creating technological solutions. I am currently in my second semester of Software Engineering at Unicesumar.<br></br><br></br>
        I am currently working with my parents in their food-related business, but I am in search of other opportunities. I believe I am ready to face new challenges and, in doing so, grow even further with them.
